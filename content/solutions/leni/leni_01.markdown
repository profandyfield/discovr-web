There are several ways to enter the Oxoby data, hereâ€™s one of them:

``` r
oxoby_tib <- tibble::tibble(.rows = 36) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
        singer = c(rep("Bon Scott", 18), rep("Brian Johnson", 18)) |> forcats::as_factor(),
        offer = c(1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5)
        ) 

# You can go on to save this tibble to a csv in your data folder using:

oxoby_tib |> 
  readr::write_csv(here::here("data/acdc.csv"))
```
