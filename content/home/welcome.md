This website contains materials relating to the forthcoming [Discovering Statistics Using R and RStudio (2nd edition)](https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/books/dsur/).

* The `discovr` menu gives information about interactive R tutorials that accompany the book.
* The `solutions` menu gives access to Smart Alex solutions, R code, and Labcoat Leni solutions.
* The `About` menu tells you about me, so probably don't bother with that one.
