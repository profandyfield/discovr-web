  abstract = {The study investigates (1) the effectiveness of using eLearning-embedded stories and pictures in order to improve learning outcomes for students and (2) how universities can adopt innovative approaches to the creation of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) resources and embed them in educational technology for teaching domain-specific content, such as statistical literacy – a widely documented difficult subject for students to master. Current didactic approaches for statistics commonly do not arouse student attentiveness and enthusiasm. New educational theories related to contextualism and learning through student-relevant experiences and technologies establish encouraging options to improve educational relevance. The author suggests that contextualizing theories embedded in eLearning systems can eliminate barriers for learning and can serve as a valuable technique that encourages students to learn using scenarios that are more relevant to them. The authors examine empirical data on students’ learning and interpretation of the topic studied. The data are instrumental in determining the broader context of learning, including affective dimensions and student interpretations. Based on the proposed approach, a trans-disciplinary application is possible.},

	abstract = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},
